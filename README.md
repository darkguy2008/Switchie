## Compatibility

This app has been developed and tested under Windows 10 LTSC (Version 10.0.17763.2237). There's some changes pending to make it work with other Windows versions, including Windows 11 (**big thanks to MScholtes!** https://github.com/MScholtes/VirtualDesktop - without his changes this app wouldn't be possible). I aim to work on those in the upcoming weeks. Thanks for your understanding!

## Motivation

Since Windows 10 there's native support for virtual desktops, however, the UI/UX for switching between them isn't as efficient as it is with other OSes, and there's only a few fixed hotkeys to swap between desktops, no realtime view of all your windows, and to get to the official UI you have to press Win+Tab, a very weird (and sometimes confused with others) hotkey to do so.

I've been a longtime Linux user as well and one of the things I always loved from the desktop environments there is the desktop pager. This project's goal is to emulate that behavior: To give you a realtime view of the windows you have in all your virtual desktops, with a small thumbnail/preview of their location, z-order and icon, and the ability to **drag and drop** windows between virtual desktops!

Oh joy, imagine working in a heavy task with like 10 windows open, and then all of a sudden you need to "switch context" and do something else that's unrelated to the task you're working on, but you don't want to minimize all windows and lose your train of thought. This is where this app comes in handy - you just create a new desktop, and then use this app to switch to a new one, get on the task at hand, and once finished, you just click the previous desktop and voilÃ¡! You keep working as if nothing happened ðŸ˜‰
